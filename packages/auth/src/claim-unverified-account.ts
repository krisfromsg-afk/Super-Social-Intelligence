/**
 * Runs BEFORE better-auth inserts a social `Account` row. It must be a before
 * hook: better-auth defers `account.create.after` hooks until the HTTP handler
 * has returned, by which point `link-account.mjs` has already marked the user
 * verified (so an after hook sees no placeholder) and a throw there would land
 * after the row committed. A before hook runs synchronously inside
 * `createWithHooks`, ahead of the insert, and a throw propagates to
 * `unable_to_link_account`.
 *
 * With `requireLocalEmailVerified: false` a trusted provider may link into an
 * unverified local user (a placeholder that never proved the mailbox), but only
 * a provider with an entry in `EMAIL_ATTESTATION_BY_PROVIDER` whose attestation
 * passes may claim it: Google through the id token's `email_verified: true`
 * (the hook only reads the claim), Facebook under the accepted policy that it
 * only exposes an email the Facebook account has confirmed (better-auth itself
 * marks such a user unverified). The attesting sign-in is the first
 * proof of ownership, so every earlier login method (password or social) and
 * every session on that placeholder is untrusted and removed before the link —
 * otherwise a pre-registered login would keep working once the real owner's
 * sign-in marks the user verified.
 *
 * After a Facebook claim the user still has `emailVerified: false` (better-auth
 * only marks a user verified from a provider that says so), so a later Google
 * sign-in with a verified claim will claim the account again and remove the
 * Facebook row and sessions; that is accepted and recovers on the next
 * Facebook sign-in.
 *
 * A user with no accounts that was created within `FRESH_SIGN_UP_WINDOW_MS` is a
 * brand-new OAuth sign-up and is left alone. An older user with no accounts is a
 * placeholder (possibly mid-claim by a concurrent request) and goes through the
 * normal checks: a provider without an attestation strategy is refused, an
 * attesting one still revokes sessions.
 *
 * Fails closed: no endpoint context, a missing user, a provider without an
 * attestation strategy, a failed attestation or a cleanup failure all throw and the
 * link is refused.
