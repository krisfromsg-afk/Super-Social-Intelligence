 *
 * - `messenger`: `contentAttributes`-driven button template converts to a
 *   Facebook `web_url` button (`integrations/messenger/.../outgoing-message/index.ts`

 * - `telegram`: `buildCanonicalInlineButton` maps `buttonType: "url"` to an

 *   (`integrations/telegram/.../outgoing-message/send-button.ts`).
 *
 * Every other channel silently degrades a `buttonType: "url"` quick reply:
 * WhatsApp turns it into an interactive reply id (the URL string becomes the
 * tapped reply's id, not a link), Instagram (both the direct and
 * Facebook-mediated integrations) turns it into a plain text quick reply
 * whose payload is the URL string, and Zalo/TikTok's outgoing `sendMessage`
 * handler does not read `quickReplies` at all, so the button is dropped
 * entirely. Callers that need a URL to be genuinely openable by the contact
 * (e.g. a webview picker) must gate on this set and fall back to a
 * non-button prompt for every other channel — this file already documents
 * that callers must gate channel-specific button behavior; this constant is
 * declarative capability data, not channel-branching logic, so it is safe to
 * keep here.
