 * enqueue work here whenever running it on a latency-sensitive domain worker
 * would starve customer-facing throughput during a burst. Current tenants are
 * the Coexist/Customer-Scan media backfill jobs (attachment mirroring, contact
 * avatar mirroring); future light-but-bulky jobs can join with their own action.
