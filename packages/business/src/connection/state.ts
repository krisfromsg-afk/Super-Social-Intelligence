/**
 * Pure Connection status state machine. It depends only on status types and
 * the standard `ChatbotXException`, so it can be unit-tested without a
 * database and reused by both `ConnectionStateService.transition` (DB writes
 * + audit) and any future dry-run/preview caller.
 *
 * Families: ACTIVE = `connected | degraded` (quota held, `Inbox.status =
 * connected`). INACTIVE = `needs_reauth | paused | disconnected` (quota
 * released, `Inbox.status = disconnected`).
 *
 * Invariant: quota transitions are calculated at active/inactive edges.
 * `quotaEdge` is the single source of truth callers use to decide whether to
 * consume or best-effort release quota — never re-derive it ad hoc.
