/**
 * Pins the plan's "single writer" invariant for `Inbox.status`: every
 * channel-active/inactive transition should flow through the `Connection`
 * FSM (`ConnectionStateService.transition`'s `mirrorInboxStatus`) or the
 * legacy inbox service, not a bespoke direct `.update(inboxModel)` —
 * otherwise `Connection.status` and `Inbox.status` silently drift (see the
 * messenger/instagram disconnect billing bug this guard exists to catch a
 * repeat of).
 *
 * `connection/state-service.ts`'s `mirrorInboxStatus` no longer writes
 * `inboxModel` directly: it calls `inboxRepository.updateConnectionMirror`
 * (`packages/database/src/repositories/inbox/repository.ts`), the single
 * remaining low-level writer, out of this guard's `packages/business/src`
 * scope by construction (D10).
 *
 * Allow-listed exceptions, both pre-existing and intentional:
 *   - `inbox/service.ts` — the legacy `create`/`disconnect` API kept for
 *     every not-yet-migrated channel (telegram, zalo, whatsapp, tiktok,
 *     webchat, smtp, api); Phase 5 removes this exception.
 *   - `integration-context/auth-store.ts` — the pre-backfill fallback for
 *     an `Integration<Channel>` row with no `Connection` counterpart yet.
 *
 * A new match outside this list means a new bypass was just introduced —
 * route it through `connectionStateService`/`inboxService` instead of
 * widening the allow-list.
