description: Use as the last step of every new feature or new operation (every one ships a public procedure — AGENTS.md invariant 23), and after adding, renaming, or removing a public oRPC procedure or changing an operation's MCP visibility. The CLI and MCP server generate their surface at runtime from the live OpenAPI spec, but repo-local docs still drift. This skill lists what to check and update, plus how to catch a silent CLI command-name collision before it ships.

# CLI & MCP docs sync (ChatbotX)

`apps/cli` and `apps/mcp-server` never need a code change for a normal new
endpoint — they both fetch `GET /api/public-spec.json` (generated from
`publicRouter`, see the `orpc-api` skill) and derive their command/tool
surface from it at runtime, cached for an hour. What does **not** update
itself is the human-facing documentation that describes that surface. Skipping
this after a public API change is how the docs quietly drift from what
`chatbotx --help` / `tools/list` actually returns.

## 1. Confirm the operation is live and named right

Before touching any doc, verify the new/changed operation in the generated
spec:

```bash
pnpm --filter builder test -- public-spec-operations.test.ts public-spec-mcp.test.ts
```

Check:
- `operationId` is what you expect — it becomes the MCP tool name
  (`toSnakeCase(operationId)` in `apps/mcp-server/src/openapi-loader.ts`).
- `summary`/`description` read well standalone — `buildToolDescription` joins
  them verbatim into the MCP tool description an LLM sees.
- If the endpoint should appear in the MCP default connection payload, its
  route sets `spec: mcpSpec({ visibility: "default" })` (see `orpc-api`
  skill) — otherwise it's reachable only via the `search_tools`/`call_tool`
  meta-tools.
- An agent could use it cold: every input id names the operation that supplies
  it, and the response is data the agent can act on (a result-returning
  operation returns the link/preview/stats itself — see `orpc-api`,
  "Result-returning operations").
- Nothing in the feature's UI is left without a matching operation, unless it is
  on the invariant 23 exempt list.

## 2. Check for a silent CLI command-name collision

The CLI derives command names from `{path, method}` alone via
`pathAndMethodToCommandName` (`apps/cli/src/openapi-loader.ts`) — it does not
see `operationId`. Two operations under the same resource can reduce to the
same name; `toolsToCommands` keeps the first registered and **silently drops
the second** (stderr warning, exit code 0 — easy to miss in CI).

```bash
pnpm --filter chatbotx test                              # pins known collisions,
                                                          # apps/cli/__tests__/openapi-loader-command-names.test.ts
CHATBOTX_API_URL=<local-builder-url>/api \
  pnpm --filter chatbotx dev:cli -- --refresh-spec <group> --help
```

Watch stderr for `Warning: duplicate command name "..." — skipping`. If your
new endpoint collides with an existing command, you have two choices: rename
one side's path/verb so the derived names differ, or accept the collision and
document it (step 3). The MCP server does not have this problem — its tool
names come from the (test-enforced-unique) `operationId`, not a path/method
heuristic.

## 3. Update repo-local docs

Do all that apply — a partial update is worse than none, because the files
disagree with the generated surface:

| File | What lives here | Update when |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/cli/README.md` | Full command reference by resource group, plus the "Known command-name collisions" section | A command group is added/renamed, or step 2 found a new collision |
| `apps/mcp-server/README.md` | MCP default-tool table and runtime/setup notes | A `visibility: "default"` operation is added/removed/recategorized, or MCP runtime behavior changes |

Published skill/agent distribution docs live in the separate `chatbotx-agent`
package, not this repo's `skills/` directory. If the public CLI/MCP surface
changes, sync the matching docs there in the same product change.

That repo also runs its own automated check
(`ChatbotXIO/chatbotx-agent/.github/workflows/upstream-drift.yml`): daily, and
immediately after `publish-cli.yml`/`publish-chatbotx-mcp.yml` here publish a
new version (via a `repository_dispatch` call those workflows make, gated on
the `CHATBOTX_AGENT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret — see the "Notify chatbotx-agent"
step in each). It compares the live CLI `--help` output and the live MCP
default-tool set against `chatbotx-agent`'s docs and opens/updates a GitHub
issue there on drift. It is a safety net for when this manual sync step is
missed, not a substitute for doing it in the same PR — the issue only
surfaces after the surface has already shipped.

For `apps/mcp-server/README.md`'s "Available tools" section: the tool-count
claim ("current default set has N tools") and the per-category tool list must
match whatever the codebase marks `visibility: "default"`. `apps/builder/__tests__/public-spec-mcp.test.ts`
pins this README against the live default tool set and fails CI on drift.

## 4. Verify against a live instance, not just the docs

```bash
pnpm --filter chatbotx dev:cli -- --refresh-spec <new-group> --help
pnpm --filter chatbotx-mcp dev:mcp   # then call tools/list against it
```

Confirm the command/tool you documented actually appears with the flags you
wrote down — the generated surface is the ground truth; the docs describe it,
never the reverse.

## Stop condition

New/changed public operation shipped → spec test green, collision check run,
every applicable repo-local doc updated and cross-checked against the generated
surface, command/tool verified live. Skipping the collision check or leaving a
listed file stale is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.
