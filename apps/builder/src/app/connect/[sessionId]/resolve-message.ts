import type { ConnectSessionStatus } from "@chatbotx.io/database/partials"

/**
 * Which message block `/connect/{sessionId}` shows for a given
 * `ConnectSession.status` (or `null` when the session id resolved to
 * nothing at all). `"pending"`/`"awaiting_selection"` are still-in-flight
 * states, mapped to `"processing"` (auto-refreshing), never `"failed"`.
 * `"authorized"` is a transient active status `claimAuthorization`
 * (`packages/business/src/connect-session/service.ts`) writes to atomically
 * claim an OAuth callback before exchanging its code — `attachAuthorization`
 * moves it on to `awaiting_selection` moments later — kept here (mapped the
 * same as the other in-flight states) so a page load that lands mid-claim
 * doesn't fall through to `"failed"`.
 * Every other value (including a genuinely unknown future
 * status) falls back to `"failed"` rather than silently misreporting
 * progress as success.
 *
 * Extracted as a pure function so this mapping — the one behavior in this
 * page with real branching to get wrong — is unit-testable without
 * `@testing-library/react` (not a dependency of this app) or a React
 * render harness.
