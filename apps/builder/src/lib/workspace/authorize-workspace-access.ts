 * doesn't fit a GET (e.g. an array too large for a query string, or a

 * exception — never add a route here that mutates anything.
 *
 * The two allow-lists below (`READ_ONLY_TOKEN_ALLOWED_POST_PATHS` and
 * `READ_ONLY_POST_PATHS`) are NOT the same list: a route can be a read for
 * the trial/MAC-limit gate (invariant #14 — every read stays open regardless
 * of caller) without also being safe to expose to a `read_only`
 * WorkspaceApiToken (a narrower, separately-reviewed capability). Each path
 * opts into each Set below individually.
 *
 * - `ADS_CAMPAIGNS_INSIGHTS_PATH` (`/v1/ads/campaigns/insights`): `adIds` can
 *   carry up to `MAX_INSIGHTS_AD_IDS` (500) entries, too large to safely fit
 *   a GET query string across every proxy/client.
 *   `messagingAdCampaignService.listInsights` performs no writes on any
 *   success path — it only reads (optionally refreshing a Graph-backed
 *   cache). On a Graph-190 expired-token error, though,
 *   `withTokenInvalidation` (`messaging-ads-connection/graph-reads.ts`)
 *   transitively writes `MessagingAdsConnection.status = "invalid"` via
 *   `markInvalid` — the same cache-refresh write path every cached Graph
 *   read (including plain GETs) already shares, not a hole specific to this
 *   POST-for-read route. Allow-listed for read_only tokens only — it has
 *   never been reviewed against the trial/MAC-limit gate, so it stays out of
 *   `READ_ONLY_POST_PATHS`.
 * - `CONVERSATIONS_LIST_POST_PATH` (`/workspaces/{workspaceId}/conversations/list`):
 *   cursor-pagination body, no writes on any path. Allow-listed for the
 *   trial gate only — not yet reviewed for read_only-token exposure, so it
 *   stays out of `READ_ONLY_TOKEN_ALLOWED_POST_PATHS` until that review
 *   happens.
 * - `FILTER_VALUE_LABELS_POST_PATH`
 *   (`/workspaces/{workspaceId}/contact-filter/value-labels`): up to 100 ids
 *   per entity type, too large for a GET query string. Primary-key lookups
 *   that only read, so the filter's names keep resolving on a trial-expired
 *   workspace. Trial gate only — not reviewed for read_only-token exposure.
 * - `BROADCAST_AUDIENCE_PREVIEW_TOKEN_PATH`
 *   (`/v1/broadcasts/audience/preview`): the audience filter is a JSON
 *   body, so POST. They only select contact inboxes and never write, so they
 *   stay open on a trial-expired workspace. They are NOT allow-listed for
 *   `read_only` tokens: unlike `broadcasts.getAudience` (bounded by broadcasts
 *   that already exist) they page every contact of the workspace and accept
 *   an arbitrary `contactFilter`.
