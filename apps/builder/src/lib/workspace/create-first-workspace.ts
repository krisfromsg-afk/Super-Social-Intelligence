/**
 * First-channel path: the user has no workspace yet, so one is created before
 * the channel connects. Shared by the legacy JSON-state OAuth callback
 * (`app/integrations/[...integration]/callback.ts`) and
 * `startChannelConnect` (`features/channel-connect/lib/start-channel-
 * connect.ts`, itself shared by the Instagram, Instagram-via-Facebook, and
 * Messenger connect-start routes) so every caller turns a plan-limit
 * failure into a redirect back to `/channels/create` with a translated
 * message, never a bare 500.
 *
 * Idempotent on `ownerId` (regression I7): this runs from a plain GET route
 * reached by a redirect, not a POST — a browser back-button retry, a
 * double-navigation, or a replayed request must reuse the user's existing
 * workspace instead of minting a second "New Workspace" every time. Without
 * this check, `workspaceService.create` has no such guard (it isn't meant
 * to — callers that deliberately want an ADDITIONAL workspace, e.g.
 * Settings → "New workspace", must still be able to create one), so the
 * idempotency has to live here, at the "this is the user's FIRST workspace"
 * call site specifically. `findActiveByOwner` excludes a workspace mid
 * soft-delete, so a user who deleted their only workspace gets a fresh one
 * instead of being handed back the one that's about to be purged.
 *
 * Accepts an optional `tx`: `startChannelConnect`'s plain OAuth-start
 * path (no `beforeStart` hook) passes `connectionService.startSession`'s
 * own transaction through here instead of resolving a workspace up front,
 * so this insert and the `ConnectSession` it's starting commit or roll
 * back together — a connect attempt that fails before ever reaching the
 * provider never leaves an empty orphan workspace behind.
