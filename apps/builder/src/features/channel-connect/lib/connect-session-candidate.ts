/**
 * Generic core behind every per-account connect action (Messenger's
 * `connectMessengerPage`, Instagram's `connectInstagramAccount` and
 * `connectInstagramAccountViaFacebook`, and any future channel the picker
 * grows) — they were ~95% identical, differing only in which credential they
 * resolve, which row they look up post-connect, and which post-connect
 * follow-up they run. Session resolution, the selectable/already-connected
 * guard, the `connectTargets` call, the row lookup, and outcome shaping are
 * identical, so that part lives here once; each caller owns only its own
 * `findRow`/`runFollowUps` closures.
 *
 * `connection.inboxId` is guarded explicitly rather than cast: `connectTargets`
 * already succeeded by the time this runs — the channel IS connected — so a
 * missing `inboxId` or a `findRow` failure must never downgrade the outcome
 * to `failed`/`unknown`; it only disables coexist eligibility and skips the
 * row-dependent follow-up, logged at `error` so it's never silently lost.
