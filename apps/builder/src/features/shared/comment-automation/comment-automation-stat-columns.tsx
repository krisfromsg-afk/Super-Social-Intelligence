 * pass `false` — Threads is the only such channel — and Seen and Clicked are
 * dropped, because on such a channel the counters measure the public comment
 * reply, which has neither. It describes the CHANNEL, not the automation: a
 * Messenger automation configured with no private branch keeps all six columns
 * and simply reads zero, the same as it always has.
 *
 * Unlike broadcast's equivalent this needs no stats store: the counters are
 * columns on the row itself, already in hand by the time the table renders.
