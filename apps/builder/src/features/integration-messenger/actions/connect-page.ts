/**
 * Connects one Facebook page from a `ConnectSession` in `awaiting_selection`,
 * as a plain server function so both transports can call it: the oRPC route
 * the batch picker posts to (`api/connect.ts`, `CONNECT_CONCURRENCY` at a
 * time) and the server action kept for any non-picker caller.
 *
 * Replaces the pending-auth-cookie skeleton (`runConnectSequence` + `getUserPages`
 * re-fetch + `messengerIntegrationService.connectPage` — all three names
 * removed by this migration, kept here only as historical context) with
 * the unified `ConnectionService.connectTargets`, which already does the
 * lookup/duplicate/quota/FSM/webhook-subscribe work generically. This
 * function's own job shrinks to: resolve session context (workspace,
 * branding) via `connectSessionCandidate`, then run Messenger's own
 * post-connect follow-ups (persistent-menu branding, workspace-logo push,
 * tag-sync enqueue) that `connectTargets` deliberately does not — those are
 * product features layered on top of the generic connect, not part of it.
 *
 * Two deliberate, minor, display-only scope reductions versus the old flow
 * (both accepted rather than adding more plumbing to a generic connect
 * path for a legacy-only need):
 * - No `persistIntegrationUserInfo` call: that recorded the connecting
 *   Facebook user's own identity (name/avatar) from the *user-level* OAuth
 *   token. The unified session model only retains each candidate's own
 *page-level* token past `listCandidates`, so that identity isn't
 *   available here.
 * - `addBranding` pushes the persistent-menu entry straight to the Graph
 *   API; `runMessengerFollowUps` now also seeds `IntegrationMessenger
 *   .persistentMenus` with that same entry once the push succeeds (only
 *   when the row has no menu yet — a fresh connect always does), matching
 *   the old `connectPage({persistentMenus: [brandingMenuEntry]})`
 *   insert-time value without needing it at insert time.
