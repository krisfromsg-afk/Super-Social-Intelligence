# Workspace API tokens

This document is for developers adding or changing workspace-token (public
API) surfaces. Workspace API tokens are bearer credentials, so their storage,
lookup, and scoping rules are security boundaries.

## Token model

Tokens live in the `WorkspaceApiToken` table
(`packages/database/src/schema/workspace-api-token.ts`). A workspace may hold
several named tokens, capped at `MAX_WORKSPACE_API_TOKENS` (10) — the cap is
enforced inside a transaction under a per-workspace `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
(`workspaceApiTokenRepository.lockWorkspaceTokens`) so concurrent creates
cannot race past it.

Only a SHA-256 digest of the token is persisted (`tokenHash`, unique). The
plaintext is shown exactly once, at creation time. `tokenPrefix` stores the
first 12 characters for display; legacy rows minted before the column existed
have `tokenPrefix: null` and are verified by hash lookup only. New tokens are
minted as `cbx_ws_<random>` by `generateWorkspaceToken()` from
`@chatbotx.io/business/workspace-api-token/credentials` — the single sanctioned
source of bearer-credential material (CSPRNG; never `Math.random()`-backed
helpers). `hashToken()` in the same module is the single hashing
implementation for all API bearer tokens, so generation and verification can
never drift.

Each token carries two orthogonal authorization axes:

| Axis | Values | Enforced where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `permission` | `full`, `read_only` | `workspaceTokenAuthMidddleware` — a `read_only` token may only use GET/HEAD; DELETE is denied. |
| `scopes` | `null` or an array of resource areas | `requireTokenScope` middleware, composed per-endpoint by `workspaceTokenAuthAPIForScope`. |

`scopes: null` means unrestricted ("All scopes") — every legacy row and every
default row. A non-null array is an explicit allow-list, frozen at creation:
a token scoped to `["contacts"]` is denied every route outside that scope,
including scopes that ship later (only `null` tokens gain future scopes
automatically). Scope values are defined by the `workspaceApiTokenScopes` zod
enum in `packages/database/src/partials/workspace-api-token.ts` and stored as
plain `text[]`, so adding a scope is an enum change, never a migration.

The `analytics` scope covers both `/v1/error-logs`
(`apps/builder/src/features/error-logs/api/public.ts`) and, as of the public
analytics router, every `/v1/analytics/*` route
(`apps/builder/src/features/analytics/api/public.ts`).

The `appointments` scope existed in the enum and UI registry for some time
before any endpoint used it — see "Appointments scope — endpoint-to-scope
table" below for the full surface now behind it.

## The default token and `{{api_key}}`

Exactly one row per workspace may have `isDefault = true` (partial unique
index). That row backs the `{{api_key}}` system field and is:

- minted lazily on first `{{api_key}}` resolution
  (`workspaceApiTokenService.resolveDefaultTokenPlaintext`), racing inserts
  resolved by re-select;
- the only token whose plaintext is recoverable after creation — it carries
  `encryptedToken`, an AES-GCM blob bound to its workspace via AAD
  (`workspace-api-token:<workspaceId>`) so it can never be decrypted under
  another workspace;
- always `permission: "full"`, `scopes: null`, and exempt from the token cap;
- upgraded lazily from the deprecated plaintext `Workspace.token` column for
  legacy rows (the column is read-only for this purpose and never consulted
  during auth).

A decrypt failure degrades `{{api_key}}` to `null` in message rendering
(`packages/variables/src/utils.ts`) instead of failing the whole render.

## Auth flow

`workspaceTokenAuthMidddleware` (`apps/builder/src/middlewares/workspace-token-auth.ts`
— triple-d, preserved typo) runs, in order:

1. Extract the token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The `?token=`
   query param is deprecated (leaks into access logs) and only kept for
   existing integrations; its use is logged.
2. Pre-auth IP-keyed rate limit — invalid tokens never reach the
   per-workspace limiter, so this is the defense against token-guessing
   floods.
3. Hash-only lookup: `hashToken(token)` →
   `workspaceApiTokenService.findWorkspaceByTokenHash`, cached up to 300s per
   token hash and tag-invalidated on delete (revocation is normally
   near-instant; the TTL bounds Redis-failure races). Negative lookups are
   never cached.
4. Per-workspace rate limit, scheduled-deletion check (403), the
   `read_only` method gate, and — for mutations only — the owner-quota/trial
   gate (`checkWorkspaceOwnerAccess`), mirroring `workspaceActionClient`. An
   expired workspace stays readable via the public API (invariant #14).
5. The context receives a projected `RequestApiToken`
   (`id`, `workspaceId`, `permission`, `scopes`, `isDefault`) — never the full
   row, so a careless `logger.info({ apiToken })` in a handler cannot leak
   `tokenHash` or `encryptedToken`.

## Adding a workspace-token endpoint

There is deliberately no unscoped `workspaceTokenAuthAPI` export. Every
endpoint must declare its resource scope:

```ts
import { workspaceTokenAuthAPIForScope } from "@/orpc"

const workspaceTokenAuthAPI = workspaceTokenAuthAPIForScope("broadcasts")
```

Per-feature workspace-token procedures live in
`features/<feature>/api/public.ts` (see
`apps/builder/src/features/broadcasts/api/public.ts` for the
pattern), exporting a named `<resource>PublicRouter` with CRUD-style keys
(`list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`). Register it eagerly, nested
under the resource name, in `apps/builder/src/routers/public.ts` (feeds
`/api/spec.json`); a feature with no private/session procedures is not
mounted in `apps/builder/src/routers/index.ts` at all.

Workspace-token APIs authenticate the workspace, not a member — member
permission scoping (e.g. `onlyAssignedContacts`, `emailAndPhone`) does NOT
apply. `contactService.list` (unscoped — the public API handler passes no
`scope`) and `contactService.findPublicContactOrFail` always run "unscoped":
a token sees every contact in the workspace, with full email/phone (no PII
masking), regardless of any member's `emailAndPhone`/`onlyAssignedContacts`
permission. The private path resolves a `scope` from the member's
permissions and calls the same `contactService.list` method — see
`.agents/skills/business-data-access/SKILL.md`. When a token surface returns
contacts or contact-derived data, make the intended scope explicit in the
API contract and tests.

The `contacts` scope also covers `GET /v1/channel-posts` and
`GET /v1/channel-posts/options/by-ids`. These endpoints list the workspace's
tracked-comment post catalog and resolve post labels by id. Their ids are the
only values accepted by a `contactFilter` condition whose field is
`commentedOnPost`; callers should discover ids through this catalog instead of
using a social platform's external post id.

### PUT vs. PATCH on a resource's own id

House rule, enforced by
`apps/builder/__tests__/public-spec-operations.test.ts` ("every PUT/PATCH
addressing a resource by its trailing path id matches its body's
required-ness"): **PUT replaces a resource wholesale** — every body field is
required, because omitting one would leave the resource in an undefined
state — **PATCH merges a partial change** — every body field is optional,
and an omitted field is left untouched. This only applies to a route whose
last path segment is the resource's own id/name placeholder
(`/v1/products/{id}`); a sub-resource setter (`/{id}/enabled`) or a
collection route (`/v1/bot-fields`) doesn't address "the whole resource" the
same way, and the guard skips both.

Two things the guard's `required.length` check cannot see, so a reviewer has
to check them by hand:

- **A zod `.default(...)` field is indistinguishable from a genuinely
  optional one** in the generated JSON Schema — both drop out of `required`.
  A PUT whose schema has one truly-required field and twenty defaulted ones
  passes the guard, but if the handler does a full-column overwrite (as
  opposed to only touching the fields present in the parsed body), every
  defaulted field the caller omits silently resets to its default. Before
  adding a `.default()` to a field on a PUT body, confirm the handler
  actually treats an omitted field as "leave it in its current value," not
  "have zod fill this in and treat it as an explicit write."
- **A body having a required field doesn't mean the body represents the
  whole resource.** A narrow, single-purpose mutation (e.g. a rename
  endpoint whose body is just `{name}`) can legitimately sit at the
  resource's own path and pass the guard while still not being a true
  "replace everything" PUT. That's a naming/semantics call for the route's
  author, not something the guard enforces.

### Deprecated back-compat aliases

Removing or renaming a released endpoint (path, method, or operation name)
is a breaking change for any existing API-token caller — the public surface
is under a compatibility guarantee. Instead of deleting the old route
outright, add it back as a `deprecated: true` alias that delegates to the
same handler/service call as its canonical sibling (no duplicated business
logic): see `inboxes.listChannels`, `contacts.search`,
`contacts.findByCustomField`, `contacts.setCustomFieldLegacy`,
`contacts.updateLegacy`, `ads.toggleRuleStatus`, `ads.updateRuleLegacy`,
`botFields.bulkUpdate`, `templateMessages.list`, and `broadcasts.clone` for
the pattern.

`apps/mcp-server/src/openapi-loader.ts` skips any operation with
`deprecated: true` when building MCP tools, so an alias stays callable over
REST for existing integrations while staying hidden from MCP/CLI tool
listings — new agent-facing surface stays on the canonical name only.

A method-flip alias (the old route reused the same path with a different
HTTP method, e.g. `PUT` where the canonical route is now `PATCH`) needs its
own operationId — `operationId` derives from the router key, and two
operations can't share a path+method pair under the same key. The
`<name>Legacy` suffix is the convention (`contacts.updateLegacy`,
`ads.updateRuleLegacy`).

One specific case worth calling out: `inboxes.listChannels` (`GET
/v1/channels`) returned the external/platform-side id (e.g. a TikTok
username) *as* `id`. The canonical `inboxes.list` returns the internal
inbox id as `id` and exposes that external id as `sourceId` instead — a
caller migrating off the deprecated route needs to read a different field,
not just change the URL.

## Scope notes

The full endpoint-to-scope mapping is generated, not hand-maintained here —
see `/api/spec.json` (built from `apps/builder/src/routers/public.ts`) for
the authoritative, current list, and
`apps/builder/__tests__/*-public-scope.test.ts` for the tests that enforce
each feature's scope assignment at compile/test time. The 18
`*-public-scope.test.ts` files are: `ads`, `analytics`, `appointments`,
`automation`, `broadcasts`, `channels-and-integrations`, `channels`,
`contacts`, `conversations`, `coupons`, `email-topics`, `error-logs`,
`integrations`, `media`, `minigames`, `product-categories`, `products` and
`sequences`.

What follows are the scope-assignment decisions and gotchas that aren't
derivable from the code or those tests — read before adding or reassigning
an endpoint's scope.

- **Contacts** — Contacts' public surface is split by concern across
  submodules — some in `features/contacts/api/public/` (`crud.ts`,
  `tags.ts`, `custom-fields.ts`, `bulk.ts`, `export.ts`,
  `refresh-profile.ts`, `messages.ts`), some in their own owning feature's
  `api/public.ts` (`contact-notes`, `contact-sequences`, `contact-inboxes`,
  `contact-filter`, `import`) that `features/contacts/api/public.ts`
  composes in alongside its own submodules, and `contact-scan` — the one
  submodule composed directly into `apps/builder/src/routers/public.ts`
  under its own `contactScans` top-level key instead of through
  `features/contacts/api/public.ts`. Every one of them other than
  `messages.ts` calls `workspaceTokenAuthAPIForScope("contacts")` exactly
  once at import. `messages.ts` is the one exception: sending/reading
  messages, auto-replies, and flows for a contact are conversation/automation
  operations even though they hang off `/v1/contacts/{identifier}/...`, so it
  uses `inbox` (`sendMessage`, `listMessages`, `getMessage`) and `automation`
  (`triggerAutoReply`, `sendFlow`) instead.
  `apps/builder/__tests__/contacts-public-scope.test.ts` enforces this split
  — it fails compile/test if a new submodule (wherever it lives) forgets to
  declare a scope, or if `messages.ts`'s procedures drift onto `contacts`.

- **Automation** — covers flows, triggers, keywords (automated responses),
  AI agents, AI MCP servers, AI functions, AI files, ref links, Facebook Lead
  Ads automations, FB/IG/Threads/TikTok comment automations, IG story
  automations, magic links, QR codes, questionnaires (+ submissions), and
  spreadsheets — a full CRUD
  surface so an agent can build, publish, and inspect automations without
  human help via the builder UI. AI triggers were retired (dropped from the
  schema and this scope) in favor of the AI
  files/functions/MCP servers surface. Note this scope **is a contact-PII
  export path**: `GET /v1/questionnaires/{id}/submissions` returns the
  submitting contact's email and phone, matching the broadcasts-audience and
  minigames-players precedent (minting a token already requires workspace
  superAdmin). Six invariants:
  - *Keywords `type` filter* — `AutomatedResponse` serves two `FolderType`s
    off one table (`automatedResponse` for inbound/Contact,
    `outboundAutomatedResponse` for outbound/Page), disambiguated by the
    `type` column (invariant #17 in the root `AGENTS.md`). `type` must stay
    in the where-clause on every keywords path — never let it become fully
    optional in a way that drops the filter.
  - *`GET /v1/triggers` and `GET /v1/triggers/{id}` return real conditions
    and actions*, not the empty arrays the routes returned before this scope
    was widened. Any future trigger route must keep populating both via
    `triggerRepository.findWithConditions` rather than reintroducing a
    hardcoded `[]`.
  - *Comment automation `type` filter* — `CommentAutomation` serves
    fb-comments (`messenger`), ig-comments (`instagram`/`instagramFacebook`),
    threads-comments (`threads`) and tiktok-comments (`tiktok`) off one
    table. Every read and write must go through the channel's own service
    methods (`*Messenger`/`*Instagram`/`*Threads*`/`*Tiktok*`); a bare
    `workspaceId` + `id` where-clause lets `/v1/fb-comments/{id}` mutate an
    IG automation. The Threads/TikTok update and delete methods return
    nothing for a missing id, so their public handlers call
    `findThreadsOrFail`/`findTiktokOrFail` first to answer 404. The one
    cross-channel read is the `analytics.commentAutomation*` stats surface
    (scope `analytics`), which resolves the id with `findOrFail` and never
    writes.
  - *List endpoints default to all folders* — the builder's list pages scope
    to the root folder when no `folderId` is in the URL. Public list
    handlers pass `includeAllFolders: true`; omit it and `GET /v1/fb-comments`
    silently returns only unfiled automations.
  - *`type` is immutable on update* — the same shared-table discriminator that
    scopes reads also decides which worker consumer fires an automation, so a
    client-supplied `type` must never reach an update payload. The update
    request schemas still carry `type` (they derive from the create schema via
    `.partial()`), so every handler destructures it away (`const { type: _type,
    ...data } = input`) and `FbCommentAutomationWriteData` /
    `IgStoryAutomationWriteData` `Omit` it so a regression is a compile error.
  - *Every public router is scope-tested* — `apps/builder/__tests__/
    automation-public-scope.test.ts` drives the **real** routers through
    `call()` and asserts a non-`automation` token gets `FORBIDDEN` on every
    exported procedure. It iterates `Object.keys(router)`, so a newly added
    procedure is covered without a new test; a router wired to the wrong scope
    fails there.
  - *Bulk deletes and missed-comment runs* — `POST /v1/<channel>-comments/bulk-delete`
    passes that channel's `types` to `commentAutomationService.deleteMany`, so
    an id of another channel is ignored rather than deleted. The cross-channel
    `commentAutomations.*` router (`features/shared/comment-automation/api/public.ts`)
    starts a missed-comment run through the same `processMissedComments`
    function as the row action and reports its status; it never edits an
    automation.

- **Appointments** — covers appointment calendars, appointments, reminder
  dispatch audit reads, and external (Google/Outlook) calendar connections.
  Three invariants:
  - *`appUrl` must be resolved with `resolveTenantSettings`, never a
    `.query.ts` adapter.* `appointmentService.list` signs a per-row schedule
    token using `appUrl`, and the private `list-appointments.query.ts`
    adapter gets it via `assertCurrentUserCanAccessChatbot`, which resolves a
    better-auth session — a Bearer-token request has none. The public `list`
    handler in `features/appointments/api/public.ts` calls
    `resolveTenantSettings({ workspaceId })` directly instead, exactly like
    the invariant `public-list-queries-no-session.test.ts` pins for every
    other resource.
  - *External calendars must use `listWithConnectedCount`, never `list`.*
    `appointmentExternalCalendarService.list` returns raw `Integration` rows
    via a relational query; the sibling `IntegrationGoogleCalendar` table
    holds the OAuth token blob in its `auth` jsonb column.
    `listWithConnectedCount` selects explicit columns and never touches
    `auth` — it is the only safe shape to publish on this scope.
  - *Reminder dispatch listing must always pass `workspaceId` explicitly.*
    `AppointmentReminderDispatchListInput.workspaceId` is optional at the
    repository layer (it also backs the internal due-reminder scan across
    every workspace), so the public handler in
    `features/appointment-management/api/public.ts` must never omit it —
    omitting it would return dispatch rows across every workspace, not just
    the caller's.

- **Inbox** — covers conversations, conversation-scoped messages, inboxes
  (channels), saved replies (canned responses), workspace members (agents),
  and — enterprise only — teams, so an integration can build a full helpdesk
  client without a human session. Conversation and message mutations take a
  single resource id (`/v1/conversations/{id}/...`), not the private API's
  bulk-by-ids shape — and every one omits an actor (`assignedBy`/`userId`):
  a workspace token authenticates the workspace, not a user, and the
  underlying service methods already treat that field as optional. Also on
  this scope: `POST /v1/contacts/{identifier}/messages`, `GET .../messages`,
  and `GET .../messages/{messageId}` in `contacts/api/public/messages.ts` —
  see the Contacts note above for why those live under `inbox` despite their
  path. Three invariants:
  - *`conversationService.updateAssignment` scopes its `WHERE` by
    `workspaceId`, not just conversation id* — it was missing that clause
    until this scope's public routes were added, which would have made a
    bulk-by-ids assignment endpoint a cross-tenant write. Any future write on
    this service must scope by `workspaceId` the same way
    `updateArchived`/`updateBotEnabled` already do; don't reintroduce an
    `inArray(id, ids)`-only `WHERE`.
  - *`findConversation`/`findMessage` never resolve a better-auth session* —
    they used to call `assertCurrentUserCanAccessChatbot`, which throws for a
    Bearer-token request (no session exists).
    `apps/builder/__tests__/public-list-queries-no-session.test.ts` pins this
    for every public query function; add a new one there whenever a query
    function gains a public caller.
  - *Public message `create` sends without a `user`* — `messageService
    .createOutgoing`'s `user` param is optional specifically so a workspace
    token (which has no user) can send; don't reintroduce a
    `userService.findByIdOrFail(context.user.id)` call on this path the way
    the private API needs one for `tenantId`.

- **Broadcasts** — covers broadcasts, sequences, email topics, **and**
  WhatsApp message templates — four features share it because sequences,
  email topics, and message templates are broadcast-adjacent operations,
  not because they were designed together. The token picker only shows the
  bare label "Broadcasts" (`fields.tokenScopes.broadcasts`), so a
  superAdmin minting a `broadcasts` token should know it also grants full
  sequence CRUD (including deleting sequences and steps), full email topic
  CRUD, and WhatsApp template listing — there is no finer-grained scope to
  withhold just one of the four. Three things worth knowing:
  - *Cloud trial plans limit Messenger broadcast activation* — `create`,
    `updateDraft` with `saveAsDraft: false`, `schedule`, `resume`, and
    `resend` return `403 broadcastPlanLimit` when the rate exceeds 60/minute
    or a second Messenger broadcast would be `scheduled`/`sending` in the
    workspace. Its `data` contains `reason`, optional `planName`,
    `maxSendRatePerMinute`, `maxActiveBroadcasts`,
    `displayedSendRatePerMinute`, and `upgradeSpeedMultiplier`;
    `saveAsDraft: true` is never blocked. The `schedule` and `resume`
    operations accept optional nullable `sendRatePerMinute` (1-1000): omit it
    to keep the stored rate, or send `null` to clear it and use the applicable
    default when activation succeeds.
  - *`GET /v1/broadcasts/{idOrName}/audience` returns full contact PII*
    (email, phone, gender) with no field-level gating, including for a
    `read_only` token — unlike the write paths (`create`/`updateDraft`/
    `resendWithPruning`), which prune email/phone *filter conditions*
    through `pruneEmailPhoneFilterConditions` before persisting. This is
    deliberate, not an oversight: minting any workspace token already
    requires workspace superAdmin, who has full contact PII in the UI
    regardless. A `read_only` `broadcasts` token is still, in effect, a bulk
    contact-PII export path for every broadcast's audience — call this out
    to anyone issuing such a token for a narrower purpose.
  - *`upsertStep`'s request body has no `sequenceId` field* — the `{id}`
    path segment is the sole source of truth for which sequence a step
    belongs to. `publicUpsertSequenceStepRequest`
    (`features/sequences/schema/action.ts`) omits `sequenceId` from the
    shared base shape the private `upsertSequenceStepRequest` also uses. Do
    not add it back; a client-supplied `sequenceId` that disagreed with the
    path would have nothing enforcing which one wins.

- **Media** — this scope shipped in the enum/registry/i18n alongside `ads`
  but, like `ads`, carried no endpoints for a while. It now covers real
  workspace resources: the media library (folders/files CRUD, move,
  favourite) and dynamic (templated) images CRUD. As with every other
  scope, each public handler calls the same `packages/business` service
  method the private/action code calls; no business logic was duplicated
  to publish these. Three things worth knowing:
  - *Uploading a file is a three-step handshake, not a single call* —
    `mediaLibraryService.createFile` only accepts a `path` already living
    under the workspace's own storage prefix, and a workspace token has no
    session to hit the session-authenticated `/api/presigned-upload` route.
    `POST /v1/media-library/files/upload-url` mints a server-derived,
    workspace-scoped key (`presignUpload`) plus a 5-minute presigned `PUT`
    URL; the client `PUT`s the bytes to that URL, then calls
    `POST /v1/media-library/files` with the same `path` to register it.
    The key is never accepted from the caller — only the derived one is
    valid, closing the same cross-workspace vector `createFile`'s prefix
    check exists to guard.
  - *`GET /v1/media-library/files`'s `filter`/`folderId` precedence* —
    `filter: "favourite"` spans every folder and ignores `folderId`;
    `filter: "all"` and `filter: "recent"` both span every folder,
    differing only in sort order; omitting both `filter` and `folderId`
    lists root-level files only. See the comment on
    `mediaLibraryFileRepository.list`
    (`packages/database/src/repositories/media-library-file/repository.ts`)
    before changing this branch.
  - *`dynamicImages.*` never returns a raw storage key* — the DB column
    `DynamicImage.backgroundUrl` is a storage path, so every public route
    resolves it to a fetchable URL via
    `dynamicImageService.resolveBackgroundUrls` (batched once per request,
    not once per row) and also stamps an `imageUrl` trigger URL
    (`<brokerOrigin>/dynamic-images?dynamicImageId=<id>&userId={{user_id}}`)
    — the same template the builder's edit page shows the user. Never
    publish the bare `backgroundUrl` column value.

- **Channels** — covers channel configuration and operations: Messenger/Zalo
  tag sync, webchat management, Messenger personas, persistent menus, and
  SMTP. A token scoped to `["channels"]` is not authorized for workspace
  integrations.
  - *Webchat custom CSS is token-writable.* A `channels`-scoped token may set
    `customCss` without an additional in-handler permission check because
    minting a workspace token already requires workspace-super-admin access.
  - *Webchat welcome-flow ownership is always validated.* Public writes pass
    `welcomeFlowId` through `integrationWebchatService`, which verifies the
    flow belongs to the workspace before persisting it.
  - *Channel discovery.* `GET /v1/channel-integrations` (`?channel=` narrows)
    and `GET /v1/{whatsapp,messenger,instagram,zalo,tiktok}-channels[/{id}]`
    list connected channels with safe columns only (never credentials); they
    return the ids other routes need. `PATCH /v1/inboxes/{id}` currently sets
    `markReadOnOutbound` only and needs the `inbox` scope.

- **Integrations** — covers workspace integrations, AI provider credentials,
  external webhooks, and event webhooks. A token scoped to `["integrations"]`
  is not authorized for channel configuration or operations.

- **Conversation routing and AI hand-over** — `POST
  /v1/conversations/{id}/thread-control` (`action` take/release/pass/sync; scope `inbox`)
  calls the same `channel-registry` functions as the inbox UI, including the check that the contact inbox belongs to the
  conversation's contact. `bypassThreadControlLock` is not exposed. A refused
  `take` returns `status: notEscalation` (200), not an error.
  `PATCH /v1/{whatsapp,messenger}-channels/{id}/handover-resume-flow` (scope
  `channels`) replaces the UI's super-admin gate. Meta Business AI hand-over
  lives under `/v1/inboxes/{inboxId}/ai-handover/*` with scope `integrations`:
  settings (GET also returns the apply-to-all status as `applyToAll`; PUT saves,
  saving off also stops a running enable), apply-to-all (POST switch, POST
  retry) and history. Apply-to-all messages and
  hands over real customers, so the POST is bounded: `dryRun: true` returns
  `eligibleCount` and changes nothing, and a real change must carry
  `confirmCount` (the most customers the caller accepts) or it is refused when
  more are eligible at that moment, or when a previous run is still winding
  down and the change cannot start immediately. This is a check at request
  time, not a cap on the run: customers who become eligible while it
  progresses are still included. Token calls record no requesting user.

- **Messenger templates and coexist** — `/v1/messenger/templates` (list, get,
  clone, delete) and `/v1/messenger-channels/{id}/templates` (create, `/sync`)
  use scope `broadcasts`, like the WhatsApp templates. Delete removes only the
  local row (Meta has no delete in our integration; sync restores it). Clone
  targets only Pages of the token's workspace. Header image URLs (create and
  clone) must resolve to a public address, and an unauthenticated image
  download does not follow redirects. `PUT /v1/{whatsapp,messenger,instagram}-channels/{id}/coexist`
  (scope `channels`) toggles coexist history sync.

- **Channel settings and bot simulator** (scope `channels`) —
  `GET/PUT /v1/{messenger,instagram}-channels/{id}/settings` read and replace
  the welcome flow, persistent menu, ice breakers (and Messenger personas)
  through the same writers as the builder form
  (`features/integration-{messenger,instagram}/lib/update-*-settings.ts`); both
  call `flowService.assertAllExist` first, so a flow of another workspace is
  refused before anything is saved or pushed to Meta. `GET/PATCH
  /v1/tiktok-channels/{id}/comment-to-message` read (live from TikTok) and set
  Comment-to-Message via `tiktokIntegrationService`; TikTok's eligibility
  rejection text is returned as-is. `GET /v1/bot-simulator/link` returns the
  `/bs/...` preview link after the same checks the preview page runs.

- **Broadcasts** — `broadcasts.list` filters by `status`, `name`, `channel`
  and a `scheduledFrom`/`scheduledTo` window and accepts `sort`; each broadcast
  now carries its channel, subaction, template, contact filter and per-page
  targets. `POST /v1/broadcasts/{id}/stop` stays available on a trial-expired
  or over-limit workspace (the builder allows it too) but not to `read_only`
  tokens. `emailTopics.list` accepts `sort`.

- **Contacts and analytics extras** — `contacts.setCustomField` and
  `contacts.applyCustomFieldOperations` accept `clientTimezone` to anchor a
  date-only value (default: the contact's, then the workspace's zone).
  `contactScans.list` accepts `integrationId` and `sort`. Analytics adds
  `GET /v1/analytics/flows/{flowId}/smart-delay-stats` (wait/follow-up
  `{waiting, sent}` per node of the draft version; kept apart from `flowStats`
  so its shape does not change) and four comment-automation routes under
  `/v1/analytics/comment-automation/*` (replies per day, customer comments, bot
  replies, errors). The customer comment texts are PII and are returned
  verbatim to any `analytics`-scoped token, as the dashboard shows them; the
  errors route also returns each contact's name and avatar.
  `magicLinkContacts`/`refLinkContacts` deliberately omit name and avatar.

- **Workspace settings (scope `settings`)** — the 13th scope, added for
  `GET/PATCH /v1/workspace/settings`: the Default Reply flow (id) and its frequency, the bot
  reply delay (3–180 s or null), Conversions API Limited Data Use and the logo
  URL. They change what the workspace sends to customers and reports to Meta,
  so they sit outside the resource-area scopes. The service writes a strict
  allow-list of those five columns (`workspaceService.updateSettings`), so a
  token can never touch the name, plan, status, owner or tenant. Only
  `scopes: null` tokens gain the scope automatically; pick it explicitly for
  restricted tokens. No migration: scopes are stored as plain text. `logo` is read back as an absolute URL (uploaded logos are stored as storage paths) and written as an http(s) URL; an external URL is loaded by every member's browser, so set only images you trust. An empty PATCH returns the settings unchanged.

- **WhatsApp calls, CAPI and templates** — scope `integrations`:
  `GET /v1/whatsapp/calls` (cursor-paginated history of every call of the
  workspace; the recording's storage path is never returned, only
  `hasRecording`), `.../{id}/recording` (15-minute signed URL),
  `.../{id}/transcript`, `.../{id}/summary`, `POST .../{id}/summary/generate`
  (writes an AI summary; `provider` may be omitted when exactly one is
  connected, otherwise list them with `GET /v1/whatsapp/calls/summary-providers`). These are customer PII and calling
  is paid, so only `scopes: null` and explicit `integrations` tokens reach
  them. Scope `channels`: `PUT /v1/{whatsapp,messenger,instagram}-channels/{id}/capi/dataset`,
  `.../capi/test-event-code` and `POST .../capi/test-event` (the dataset is
  validated with Meta; while a test event code is set every CAPI event goes to
  Test Events). The channel list shows `capiTestEventCode` and
  `capiDisconnected`. `PUT .../{id}/capi/dataset` without `datasetId` creates
  a dataset with the channel's stored token (either way it reconnects a
  disconnected channel) and `DELETE .../{id}/capi` disconnects; custom connect stays private because it
  takes an access token. Scope `broadcasts`: `GET /v1/whatsapp/templates/{id}`,
  `POST /v1/whatsapp-channels/{id}/templates/sync`,
  `GET /v1/whatsapp/templates/catalog-products`, and WhatsApp Flows
  (`GET /v1/whatsapp/flows`, `.../{flowId}/screens`,
  `POST /v1/whatsapp-channels/{id}/sync-flows`). Scope `integrations`:
  calling settings (`GET/PATCH /v1/whatsapp-channels/{id}/calling`, `PUT
  .../calling/hours`; the Meta-side fields are applied first and the local
  switches mirrored only after Meta accepted, as in the builder; calling is
  paid and recording stores customer audio, hence the scope). Scope `inbox`:
  `POST /v1/conversations/{conversationId}/whatsapp-template` (queues an
  approved template past the 24-hour window; delivery is asynchronous and the
  worker refuses a template that is not approved or belongs to another number)
  and `.../whatsapp-call-permission` (Meta's call-permission request, limited
  by Meta to 1 per 24 h and 2 per 7 days per customer, checked first).

- **Sequences** — `sequences.list` filters by `name`, `folderId` and `active`
  and accepts `sort`; `sequences.update` accepts `folderId` (null = no
  folder). A `folderId` on create or update must be a `sequence` folder of the
  workspace, and a folder's parent must belong to the same workspace and folder
  type (`folderService.create` no longer resolves a parent by id alone).
  Managing sequence folders themselves is not exposed on the public API yet.

- **Meta Catalog and ad images** — scope `ecommerce`:
  `GET /v1/products/meta-catalog` (connection without its credential, plus the
  sync history), `GET .../meta-catalog/businesses`, `POST /v1/products/meta-catalog`
  (create an empty catalog and bind it), `POST .../select` (bind and import,
  202) and `POST .../sync` (push products, 202); a second run while one is
  active returns 409. `DELETE /v1/products/meta-catalog` disconnects (409
  while a sync or import runs, allowed on a trial-expired workspace);
  connecting stays private (Meta OAuth).
- **Channel disconnect** — scope `channels`: `DELETE /v1/messenger-channels/{id}`
  and `DELETE /v1/instagram-channels/{id}` run the builder's disconnect (Meta
  unsubscribe, running history sync ended, CAPI events removed; contacts and
  conversations kept). Like every DELETE they stay open on a trial-expired
  workspace. Connecting stays private (Meta OAuth).
  Scope `ads`: `POST /v1/ads/campaigns/upload-image` returns `imageKey`,
  `fileId` and a presigned PUT URL inside the workspace's ads-creative prefix
  (same type/size checks as the builder; the create-time preflight still proves
  ownership), and `ads.checkCampaignPrerequisites` now reports
  `reconnectNeeded`. The 25 MB base64 cap on `upload-video` is unchanged on
  purpose. A connection without a channel FK is listed with
  `integrationId: ""` and cannot be disconnected through the API.

- **Imports** — a token can run a whole import without the browser's session
  upload: `POST /v1/contacts/imports/upload-url` (scope `contacts`) and
  `POST /v1/products/imports/upload-url` (scope `ecommerce`) validate the file
  (MIME, extension, format, declared size) against the import registry, record
  a pending `import` file for the workspace and return a presigned PUT URL.
  `GET /v1/{contacts,products}/imports/files/{fileId}/headers` reads the header
  row (only for a file of that import type — another type reads as "not
  found"), and `GET /v1/{contacts,products}/import-template` returns the
  CSV text / base64 XLSX template. `contacts.import` and `products.startImport`
  (`POST /v1/products/imports`, with `columnMap`) return 409 while another import
  of that type is pending or processing; `GET /v1/products/imports` and
  `.../{id}` read product import jobs like the contact ones.

- **Minigames** — this scope shipped in the enum/registry/i18n alongside
  `ads` but, like `ads`, carried no endpoints for a while. It now publishes
  minigame CRUD, enable/disable, per-contact play-history reads, and a
  players (participants) list — its first endpoints. As with every other
  scope, each public handler calls the same `packages/business` service
  method the private/action code calls; no business logic was duplicated to
  publish these.
  - *`GET /v1/minigames/{id}/players` returns contact display PII*
    (`fullName`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `avatar` — no email/phone) with no
    field-level gating, same rationale as the broadcasts-audience note
    above.
  - *`GET /v1/minigames/{id}/plays` is not paged* and is hard-capped at 200
    records by `MAX_PLAY_RECORDS`
    (`packages/business/src/minigame/minigame-contact-service.ts`).
  - *`PUT /v1/minigames/{id}` is a full replace* and passes
    `originalPrizeQuantities: null`, so a token write honors submitted prize
    quantities verbatim — a GET → modify → PUT round-trip discards any prize
    stock decremented by plays that happened in between. `PATCH
    /v1/minigames/{id}` is the safe partial update: only the top-level
    settings objects present in the request body are merged over the current
    row, so omitting `prizeSettings` preserves live stock. Never expose
    `originalPrizeQuantities` on the public request schema.
  - *`POST /v1/minigames/bulk-delete`* deletes multiple minigames by id in
    one call, mirroring `minigameService.deleteMany` (also used by the
    private bulk-delete action).
  - *A duplicate name is a `nameAlreadyExists`/409* from `minigameService`,
    declared on all three write routes (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) — not the 500
    the raw Postgres unique violation used to produce.

### Ads scope — endpoint-to-scope table

`ads` shipped in the enum/registry/i18n from day one (alongside `channels`,
`integrations`, `minigames`, `appointments`, `media`) but carried no endpoints
until this table's routes were added — a token scoped to `["ads"]` reached
nothing before. It now covers Ads conversion-rule CRUD, the CTWA/CTM/CTID funnel and
CAPI-delivery reads, the conversion export, ad-account reads, and the full
messaging-ad campaign lifecycle (create/retry/publish/pause/delete + video
upload). Every handler below calls the same `packages/business` service
method the corresponding UI action/oRPC procedure calls
(`.agents/rules/data-access.md`).

The scope also covers three **read-only Google Ads** operations
(`googleAds.getStats`, `googleAds.listEvents`, `googleAds.getConnection`;
`apps/builder/src/features/integration-google-ads/api/public.ts`). They are
GETs, so `read_only` tokens work, and they are hidden MCP tools (reachable
through `search_tools`/`call_tool`). Writes (recording a conversion, retry,
connect, consent) stay UI-only. Two call-outs, following the questionnaires and
minigames precedents:

- *`GET /v1/google-ads/events` returns `identity.id` and Google's error text.*
  `identity.id` is the order or event ID the flow chose to send and can contain
  contact data; `error` is Google's sanitized failure text. Click IDs are
  masked and the row's click, transaction and request IDs are redacted from
  `error`; no workspace, contact-inbox or claim data is returned. Minting a
  token already requires a workspace super admin, who sees the same data in the
  settings history.
- *`GET /v1/google-ads/connection` never returns credentials*, only status, the
  conversion consent view and the synced conversion actions.

Two invariants specific to this scope:

- **The campaign-lifecycle mutations deliberately omit
  `assertWorkspaceSuperAdmin`** — present on the private `adsCampaignAPI`
  (`features/ads-campaign/api/private.ts`), it resolves the session user via
  `getCurrentUserAndTargetWorkspace`. A workspace-token request never has a
  session user (the token stack never runs `authMiddleware`), so the private
  guard would throw `errors.superAdminRequired` on every token call. Per the
  auth-flow section above, a workspace token authenticates the workspace,
  not a member, and minting a token already required the caller to be a
  workspace superAdmin — so the guard is correctly absent, not an oversight.
  Any future ads-campaign endpoint copied from the private router must drop
  this guard on the public path, the same way `features/coupons/api/public.ts`
  and the contacts public surface never re-check member-level permissions.
- **`createdBy` is `null`/omitted on every token-created campaign** — a token
  has no associated user, mirroring the `createdById: null` precedent in
  `features/coupons/api/public.ts`. Never resolve it from a session that
  does not exist on this path.

## Adding a new scope value

1. Add the value to `workspaceApiTokenScopes` in
   `packages/database/src/partials/workspace-api-token.ts` (no migration —
   the column is `text[]`).
2. Register it in `workspaceApiTokenScopeRegistry`
   (`apps/builder/src/features/workspaces/lib/workspace-token-scopes.ts`) —
   the `Record<WorkspaceApiTokenScope, …>` type fails compile until you do,
   the same invariant as `Record<ChannelType, …>`.
3. Add the `fields.tokenScopes.<scope>` label to
   `apps/builder/messages/en.json` and every other locale (CI enforces full
   key parity).
4. Use `workspaceTokenAuthAPIForScope("<scope>")` on the new endpoints.

Existing scoped tokens do not gain the new scope; only `null`-scoped tokens
can reach it.

## Token management

- Creating and revoking tokens requires the caller to be a workspace
  `superAdmin` (`requireWorkspaceTokenSuperAdmin`) — a plain member must not
  be able to bypass their granular role by minting a `full` token.
- Create/delete emit audit records (never the raw token or hash), best-effort
  so an audit failure cannot fail a committed write.
- Delete invalidates the token cache tag; a Redis failure there is logged and
  bounded by the 300s TTL.

## Channel API tokens (integration-api)

API-channel credentials (`cbx_api_<random>` tokens and signing secrets) share
the same credentials module: `generateApiChannelToken` /
`generateSigningSecret` / `hashToken` from
`@chatbotx.io/business/workspace-api-token/credentials`. They are verified
hash-only by `channelApiTokenAuthMidddleware` via
`findIntegrationApiByTokenHash`. Do not add a builder-local re-export of
these helpers — import from the business package directly.

## API-first parity guard

`apps/builder/__tests__/api-parity-manifest.test.ts` classifies every UI server
action (`features/<feature>/actions/*.ts`) in `api-parity-manifest.json` as
`covered:<feature>` (the feature has a public workspace-token router) or
`private:<reason>` (UI-only on purpose). A new action missing from the manifest
fails CI, so a UI capability cannot ship without an API decision. `covered:` is
feature-level; add the public route in the same PR when you add the action.
Entries marked `private:no public surface yet` are not yet audited, not
approved as UI-only.

## Contact reads and exports (W6 notes)

- `contacts.list`/`contacts.get` return `avatar` as a resolved URL (same as the
  builder), never the stored key.
- `contacts.export` `fields` need a kind prefix: `sys:<column>` (firstName,
  lastName, fullName, email, phoneNumber, gender, source, lastReadAt,
  blockedAt, contactId, sourceUserId = WhatsApp BSUID), `cus:<customFieldId>`,
  `tag:<tagId>`. A key without a prefix is rejected (422).
- `POST /v1/contacts/filter-value-labels` is a pure read (id lists too large
  for a query string) that names the tag ids a `contactFilter` references; it is
  allow-listed for `read_only` tokens and trial-expired workspaces. Only tags:
  sequence, broadcast, ref-link, inbox, member and team names belong to other
  scopes and come from their own list routes.
- Simpler inputs (all additive, the previous shapes still work):
  `POST /v1/conversations/{conversationId}/whatsapp-template` takes the same
  flat `templateParams` as broadcasts; the import header routes return
  `suggestedColumnMap` (the builder's header matching), and
  `POST /v1/products/imports` recognises columns and the file format itself
  when `columnMap`/`format` are omitted; `PATCH` on
  `/v1/messenger-channels/{id}/settings`, `/v1/instagram-channels/{id}/settings`
  and `/v1/inboxes/{inboxId}/ai-handover/settings` changes only the sent
  fields, and Messenger personas take `{name, profilePictureUrl}`;
  `GET /v1/whatsapp-channels/{id}/calling` returns `callHoursInput`, ready to
  edit and send to `PUT .../calling/hours`; `POST /v1/products/meta-catalog/sync`
  defaults `catalogId` to the bound catalog.
- Template broadcasts take flat `templateParams` (`{"body.1": "Ann",
  "header": "https://.../a.jpg"}`, also per `targets[]` entry) instead of
  Meta's nested `templateData`; the keys are the `parameters` that
  `GET /v1/whatsapp/templates/{id}` and `GET /v1/messenger/templates/{id}`
  now return. The server builds `templateData` with the builder's own template
  helpers; a missing, unknown or invalid key is a 422 naming the keys, and a
  multi-product (MPM) button still needs `templateData`. `templateData` keeps
  working, but not together with `templateParams`.
- `POST /v1/broadcasts/audience/preview` counts (`total`) and lists the
  contact inboxes a broadcast *would* reach (same selectors as
  `broadcasts.create`, the audience window applied) before anything exists. It
  is a pure read that stays open on trial-expired workspaces, but a
  `read_only` token cannot call it: it pages every contact of the workspace
  and takes an arbitrary `contactFilter`.
- `POST /v1/contacts/bulk/sequences/remove` is the bulk counterpart of
  `bulk/sequences`. `POST /v1/contacts/bulk/tags/by-stats` queues the same
  background job as the builder's "tag everyone behind this stat" (sources
  `broadcast`, `sequenceStep`, `commentAutomation`); it is attributed to the
  workspace owner because a token has no member. The comment-automation
  drill-down is `GET /v1/analytics/comment-automation/contacts`.
- `adsEligible` is false for Instagram accounts connected through native
  Instagram login; only Facebook-login accounts can run click-to-message ads.
- `GET /v1/bot-fields` takes `name`, `folderId` (`"0"` = no folder) and `sort`.
- BSUID and WhatsApp username are on the contact-inbox resource
  (`sourceUserId`, `sourceUsername`); a BSUID-only contact is keyed by it in
  `sourceId`.
